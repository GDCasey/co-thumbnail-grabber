This is a small tool to grab all the mix and match dakimakura thumbnails off of Cuddly Octopus' website.

It will download these thumbnail images to a folder on your local machine.

Please edit the following values at the top of Main.java before running the program.

maxSKUNumber - The Maximum SKU the it will search for images. This will change over time as more dakimakuras are added to CO.

SKUsPerThread - How many SKUs you want per thread, the lower the number the more threads will be started to download images simultaneously, keep it to something reasonable like 300-500.

filePath - The file path of the folder you want the images downloaded to. For example on MacOS my file path is /Users/myusername/Pictures/CuddlyOctopusPics/

I am not affiliated with Cuddly Octopus, I made this because I was bored.
